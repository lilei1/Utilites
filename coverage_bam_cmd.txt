#Those command lines are for calculate the reads numbers, mapped reads numbers and coverage informations for bam files:

#in the below commandlines, please replace "WBDC_338_2016-04-07_deduped.bam" with your BAM file
#Count how many reads in total in the BAM file

#Count how many reads mapped to the reference in the BAM file
