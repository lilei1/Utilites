Objective: This is for submitting the raw reads to the NCBI SRA:


Step1: Submit the [bioProject](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/bioproject/)
Follow the link and start a new BioProject. Fill out the required blanks and submitted. Once you get submitted and processed by NCBI, you are supposed to get the bioProject number, like PRJNA523236.

Step2: Submit the [biosample](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/biosample/). Follow the link and start a new BioSample.Fill out the required blanks, and download the excel file called as [Plant_1.0](). Fill out this sheet with your samples information and BioProject IDs. Then upload this file and get submitted. After processed by NCBI, you will download the [attributes file with BioSample accessions]().

Step3: Submit the [SRA](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/sra/). Follow the link and start a new SRA submit. You need to download the SRA_metadata sheet and fill out the files according to the atreribute file. Also please link the actural read file with each sample id.

Step4: Submit with commandline by this [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/preloadfiles/):
